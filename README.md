WanderLust â€“ An Airbnb Full-Stack Clone
A production-ready Airbnb clone built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and EJS.

WanderLust allows users to explore, create, edit, and delete accommodation listings, complete with reviews, validation, and a clean UI.

This project demonstrates real-world full-stack development skills: from REST APIs and database modeling to server-side rendering and robust error handling.

ðŸ”— Live Demo: WanderLust on Render

ðŸ”— GitHub Repo: Airbnb_FullStack_Project

Key Features
Listings CRUD: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for accommodation listings.

Reviews with Validation: Users can add and manage reviews, with schema validation implemented using Joi.

Robust Error Handling: Implemented a centralized error system with ExpressError for a seamless user experience and simplified debugging.

Dynamic UI: Built with server-side rendering using EJS and ejs-mate for layout inheritance.

RESTful Routing: Designed a clean, scalable, and modular route structure.

MongoDB Persistence: Data is stored and retrieved efficiently with Mongoose.

Middleware Support: Custom middleware used for user authentication, data validation, and error handling.

Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose

Templating: EJS, ejs-mate

Validation: Joi

Styling: Bootstrap, custom CSS

Dev Tools: Nodemon, Method-Override

What I Learned
Building Scalable RESTful APIs: Gained hands-on experience in building and implementing a scalable RESTful API with Express, demonstrating a clear understanding of resource-based routing and HTTP methods.

Designing MongoDB Schemas: Designed and modeled MongoDB schemas to establish efficient one-to-many relationships for listings and reviews.

Implementing Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Utilized EJS to handle dynamic content, improving performance and SEO.

Writing Modular Middleware: Developed custom middleware for authentication, validation, and error handling, highlighting a focus on clean, maintainable code.

Using MVC Architecture: Applied the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to organize the codebase, enhancing maintainability and collaboration.
